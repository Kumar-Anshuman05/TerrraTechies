Our project uses Google Cloud’s AI ecosystem, combining scalability with cutting-edge generative AI features.

Vertex AI is a powerful platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale. We used it to manage our entire AI workflow, from experimentation to production.

Gemini 2.5 Flash is Google’s top generative AI model, optimized for speed and efficiency. It allowed us to process queries and generate responses quickly, making it great for real-time situations.

Google Cloud Console gave us an integrated environment to set up services, manage resources, and monitor performance across our AI pipeline.

By combining these tools, we created a solution that is innovative, reliable, scalable, cost-efficient, and prepared for real-world impact.
